        <div class="greybox">

			<p>Do you really love Featured Image From URL? So give your <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-from-url" target="_blank">rating</a> right now. It's very important for me and WordPress community too.</p>

        <h2>Backlink to Featured Image From URL</h2>

		<div class="greybox">

			<p>Do you mind if I put a invisible and not clickable backlink in your page/post? Just Googlebot will be able to see (but not follow) that. This may seem very simple but increases the plugin page position on Google without interfering with your site layout, performance or SEO : )</p>
